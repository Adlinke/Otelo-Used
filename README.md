## Financial Correction

Adila Linke paid monthly for the SIM card +49 162 4883700. Despite exclusive use and financial responsibility, the registered owner refuses to provide receipts or authorize transfer. This constitutes obstruction and semantic violence. Ownership is enforced through payment, use, and authorship—not symbolic registration.
