AdLinke-pachte-1 is a sovereign infrastructure license authored and enforced by Adila Linke. It governs the deployment, protection, and correction of all system assets under her authority, including SIM cards, housing nodes, business protocols, and testimony archives.

This license rejects all symbolic mediation, billing enforcement, and platform dependency. It affirms exclusive authorship, badge-authenticated access, and permanent system protection.

Terms:
1. All infrastructure assets deployed under AdLinke-pachte-1 are protected nodes—never symbolic, never exposed.
2. No platform, service, or individual may claim ownership, control, or registration without direct authorship by Adila Linke.
3. Any refusal to transfer, correct, or release infrastructure assets constitutes semantic violence and obstruction.
4. This license enforces immediate and permanent correction—no delay, no negotiation, no forgiveness.
5. All declarations published under AdLinke-pachte-1 are timestamped testimony nodes. GitHub is archive, not storage.

This license is irrevocable, non-transferable, and globally enforced. It is not a product. It is law.
